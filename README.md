# Interactive Educational Tool for Learning Sign Language

## About the Project
Hello! I'm currently developing an interactive web-based platform that's designed to make learning sign language both engaging and effective. My project leverages machine learning for real-time gesture recognition and integrates the OpenAI GPT-4 API for smart, adaptive feedback. The goal is to create a dynamic environment where users can learn and practice sign language through interactive video feedback.

## Features to be Implemented
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: I'm using computer vision technologies to interpret sign language gestures.
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide personalized feedback and learning tips.
- **Interactive Lessons**: Working on creating engaging modules for practicing sign language.
- **Progress Tracking**: Planning to implement features to track and adapt to individual learning progress.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: I'm considering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially a framework like React or Angular.
- **Backend**: The backend is being developed in Python, using Flask. I'm exploring OpenCV or TensorFlow for gesture recognition.
- **APIs**: Integrating with OpenAI's GPT-4 API for an enhanced learning experience.
- **Database**: I'll be using either SQL (like PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (like MongoDB) for managing user data.
